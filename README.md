This is going to be me and Junjie first Machine Learning Project.<br>
We are sophomores attending our second hackathon.

This project uses linear regression to try and predict how a person's gender, ethinicity, parental level of education, lunch determine their score.


This model is used to address the inequality of the area the data come from. 
If the analysis shows that some groups of students consistently get lower scores, it could mean that those students aren't getting the same chances at a good education.
Vice versa, if the analysis shows that some groups of students consistently get higher scores, it could highlight that the common traits are helping the students improve in school.

This is the example dataset used to train the Artifical Intelligence.
